# Final Deliverables
Accessibility Course Development (CD) Shell  
CSCI 4390 – Senior Project

This document defines the concrete, measurable deliverables for the project. These artifacts are designed to be evaluated independently of Brightspace while remaining fully compatible with it.

---

## 1. Accessible Course Home Layout

- A redesigned **Brightspace Course Home layout**
- Uses **official Brightspace widgets only**
- Limited to **a maximum of 5 widgets** (Brightspace homepage limit)
- Designed to:
  - reduce visual and cognitive overload
  - support first-time Brightspace users
  - improve navigation for students with disabilities

This layout serves as the primary entry point for the course and establishes a consistent, accessible structure.

---

## 2. Reusable HTML Content Template Library

- A collection of **8–12 accessible HTML content page templates**
- Templates function as **selective, content-based “widgets”** instructors can embed within courses
- Designed for:
  - clear information hierarchy
  - low-cognitive-load presentation
  - WCAG-aligned structure and styling

Example template types include:
- course overview / syllabus pages
- weekly module layouts
- assignment instruction pages
- checklist or task breakdown pages
- simplified overview pages

---

## 3. Utility & Quick-Access Content Components

- Select templates and widgets will include **quick-access elements** such as:
  - links to required tools (e.g., Respondus LockDown Browser)
  - optional embedded utilities (e.g., timers for quizzes or exams, where appropriate)

These components aim to reduce friction and prevent students from searching across multiple areas of the LMS.

---

## 4. Public GitHub Repository & Deployment Site

- A GitHub repository containing:
  - reusable HTML/CSS templates
  - embedded code snippets
  - documentation and usage instructions
- A lightweight deployment site generated from the repository to:
  - preview templates
  - simplify copy/paste integration for instructors
  - provide a clear reference outside the LMS

---

## 5. Live Brightspace Demonstration Shell

- A production Brightspace course shell configured with:
  - the redesigned Course Home layout
  - selected HTML templates and widgets
- Used for:
  - midterm live demo
  - final presentation and evaluation

---

## Deliverable Evaluation Criteria

The project will be considered successful if:
- all listed artifacts are delivered within scope
- templates and widgets function as intended in Brightspace
- accessibility and usability improvements are demonstrable through comparison and analysis
