Final Deliverables

Accessible Course Home Layout
A redesigned Brightspace Course Home layout using official Brightspace widgets only, intentionally limited to up to 5 widgets (Brightspace maximum) to prevent visual overload.
This layout prioritizes clarity and task separation for:

first-time Brightspace users

students with disabilities

students who experience cognitive or navigational overload

Reusable HTML Content Template Library
A curated set of 8–12 accessible HTML content page templates that instructors can selectively choose from and embed within their courses as structured content blocks or “content-based widgets.”
These templates include:

clear navigation and content hierarchy

low-cognitive-load layouts

accessibility-aligned structure and styling

Utility & Quick-Access Content Components
Select templates and widgets will provide quick access to commonly needed course resources, such as:

links to required tools (e.g., Respondus LockDown Browser)

optional embedded utilities (e.g., timers for quizzes or exams, where appropriate)

Public GitHub Repository & Deployment Site
A GitHub repository containing:

reusable HTML/CSS template code

embedded snippets ready for copy/paste use

documentation and usage instructions
The repository will also be used to generate a lightweight deployment site for previewing templates and simplifying instructor adoption.
